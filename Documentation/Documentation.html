            <h3>What Are Computer Languages?</h3>
            <p>
                Computer languages are structured languages designed for communication
                with computers. They allow developers to write instructions that a
                computer can execute to perform various tasks, ranging from simple
                calculations to complex software applications. Computer languages
                serve as a bridge between human thought processes and machine-readable
                instructions, enabling effective interaction with computers.

            <h2>Types of Computer Languages</h2>
            <p>
                Computer languages can be broadly categorized into several types, each
                serving distinct purposes:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Low-Level Languages:</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Assembly Language:</b> A low-level language that closely
                        corresponds to the machine code specific to a computer
                        architecture. It provides a set of symbolic instructions, allowing
                        programmers to write programs that are closely aligned with the
                        underlying hardware.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Machine Language:</b> The lowest-level language, consisting of
                        binary code (0s and 1s) directly understood by the computer's CPU.
                        It is specific to each type of processor.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>High-Level Languages:</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        These languages are abstracted from the hardware, allowing
                        developers to write code that is easier to read and maintain. They
                        enable a more natural expression of algorithms and data
                        structures.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Examples:</b></li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Python:</b> Known for its simplicity and readability, making
                            it an ideal choice for beginners and professionals alike.

                            development, mobile applications, and enterprise solutions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>JavaScript:</b> Primarily used for creating interactive web
                            pages, it runs in the browser and has become essential for
                            front-end development.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Characteristics of Computer Languages</h2>
            <p>
                When evaluating computer languages, several key characteristics come
                into play:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Syntax:</b> The set of rules that defines the structure of
                    statements in the language. A clear and concise syntax enhances code
                    readability and maintainability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Semantics:</b> The meaning behind the statements written in a
                    language. Understanding semantics is crucial for writing effective
                    algorithms and ensuring accurate program behavior.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Efficiency:</b> The performance of a programming language can
                    vary significantly based on how it manages resources and executes
                    code. Low-level languages often provide better efficiency, while
                    high-level languages prioritize developer productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Portability:</b> The ability of code written in a language to run
                    on different platforms without modification. High-level languages
                    typically offer better portability, as they abstract away
                    hardware-specific details.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Ease of Learning:</b> The complexity of a language and the
                    learning curve associated with it are critical for new programmers.
                    Languages like Python are designed to be beginner-friendly, while
                    others may have a steeper learning curve.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <section id="section4">
            <h2>The Evolution of Computer Languages</h2>
            <p>
                Computer languages have evolved significantly since their inception.
                Early programming was done using machine and assembly languages,
                requiring deep knowledge of hardware architecture. The development of
                high-level languages in the 1950s and 1960s, such as Fortran and
                COBOL, marked a shift toward greater abstraction, allowing more people
                to engage in programming without needing to understand the underlying
                hardware. Over the years, new languages have emerged to address
                specific programming needs, enhance productivity, and support the
                growing complexity of software systems. The rise of the internet has
                also catalyzed the development of languages geared toward web
                development, such as JavaScript and PHP.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Understanding computer languages is fundamental to the field of computer science and software
                development. Each language offers unique features, advantages, and use cases, making it essential for
                developers to choose the right language for their specific tasks. As technology continues to evolve, the
                landscape of programming languages will also adapt, introducing new languages and paradigms that shape
                how we interact with computers.</p>
