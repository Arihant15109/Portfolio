                <p class="about-para">I'm a Fresher B.Tech student in Computer Science (AI) at
                    Medicaps University, Indore, India. I’m 17 years old and will be turning 18 in December 2024. Coding
                    is my passion, which is why I’m actively learning web development. So far, I’ve acquired skills in
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript. </p>
                <p class="about-para">I love exploring and learning new technologies in the field of computer languages
                    and development.</p>
                <p class="about-para">I am eagerly looking forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team and
                    grow professionally.</p>
                <p class="about-para">I want to learn and dive into this field to the deepest.</p>

                    <h2 class="thought-heading about-para">"My personal mindset, as I see it"</h2>
                    <li class="thought-para about-para">I believe that every person has the ability to learn and grow.
                        Everyone has the potential to become a great developer. I am always eager to learn new things
                        and explore different aspects of technology. I am open to new ideas and value learning from
                        others. The main reason I am seeking work with you is to gain firsthand experience of how the
                        industry operates and what qualities they seek in developers.</li>
                    <li class="thought-para about-para">As a fresher, I understand the challenges of entering the
                        workforce, but I believe I have an edge over many other novice developers who may be older and
                        have formal degrees. I am confident that given the opportunity to demonstrate my skills and
                        compete, I can excel. Coding is not just a job for me; it's a passion. I enjoy immersing myself
                        in new challenges and learning continuously.</li>
                    <li class="thought-para about-para">I am not looking for high pay; rather, I am eager for the chance
                        to prove myself in the industry, gain practical knowledge, and valuable experience. Whether paid
                        or unpaid, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to work with you. It would be an honor to
                        learn from your team and understand the workings of the industry firsthand.</li>
                    <li class="thought-para about-para">I am eagerly looking forward to the opportunity to contribute to
                        your team and grow professionally. Thank you for considering my application.</li>
